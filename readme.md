# Team Aquafi website project

### Website project has been done with HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

I tried to make website so dynamical as I could. At resources folder, you can find different universal resources, e.g. navbar and footer.

"js"-folder includes javascript-files and json-files.

Javascript read .json files to update latest results or news to website

.json format is absolute. If you wanna test how it works, you should follow the latest format.

1. On news.json
  "id",
  "head",
  "frontText",
  "picture", are must. *The amount of P*s is up to you.*
  
2. On results.json
  "team1",
  "team2",
  "map1",
  "map1Results", [x, x] are must. You can add map amount and results as            many you like.
